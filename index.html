          <p>
            Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
            inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
            foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Whereas
            disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
            acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent
            of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and
            belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the
            highest aspiration of the common people, Whereas it is essential, if
            man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to
            rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should
            be protected by the rule of law, Whereas it is essential to promote
            the development of friendly relations between nations, Whereas the
            peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their
            faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the
            human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have
            determined to promote social progress and better standards of life
            in larger freedom, Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to
            achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of
            universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental
            freedoms,
